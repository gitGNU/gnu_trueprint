Known bugs:
perl - an associative array that starts with 'sub' gets confusing
perl - trueprint cannot tell the difference between the shift-right
	operator "<<" and the start of a "here" document "<<".  Perl
	can tell the difference because it knows whether it is expecting
	an operator or a value, but trueprint is a program of very little
	brain and takes as many shortcuts when parsing as possible...
