Known bugs:
perl - an associative array that starts with 'sub' gets confusing
perl - trueprint cannot tell the difference between the shift-right
        operator "<<" and the start of a "here" document "<<".  Perl
        can tell the difference because it knows whether it is expecting
        an operator or a value, but trueprint is a program of very little
        brain and takes as many shortcuts when parsing as possible...
perl - the remainder of a line after a heredoc start will not be properly
        scanned for quoted strings.
