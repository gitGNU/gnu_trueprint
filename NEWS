Reverse history of Trueprint:

Version 5.0: Trueprint GNU
	Changed code to adhere to GNU coding standards.
	Added long options.  Short options that used to start
	with '+' now start with '--', e.g. +I is now --I.
	Default is "off" for page breaks after function calls.
	Added texinfo documentation.
020299 4.1.2 Fixed waiting for child pid so lpr message appears
	before trueprint returns.
	Fixed bad interaction between turning off linewrap and
	turning off linecount.
	Fixed get_function_name() so it can be called many times
	for the same page (by removing static qualifier to
	current_function).
	Included changes from James Card: added .H & .C as valid C++.
	Fixed tab expansion (tab character was included in output).
072298 4.1.1 Added C++ & Verilog support and updated the man page.
	Fixed crash when $USER not set. Map lf/cr (MS-DOS line end) to
	cr, and cr/ff to ff.  Added -J for holepunch gap at top of
	page. Improved message for an unknown option.  Empty
	input -> no print job.  Added file COPYING, which contains
	the GPL.

210391 2.9.7 Add -T<tabsize>
140391 2.9.6 Initialize braces_depth at end of first pass (finally!)

250291 2.9.2 Fixed C parsing to cope with function ptr argument.
220291 2.9.1 Changed definition of line indent in postscript.c to get line at
	right position.
070291 2.9 Changed meanings of -F, -f, -b and -x to align with users' manual
110191 2.8.1 Added -F -f to suppress File and function indices and added
	-b to suppress page breaks at function end
030191 2.8 Got -l and -w options working properly, added -c<n>, altered
	language dynamically according to filename extension.
311290 2.7 Merged 2-on-1 and 4-on-1 with landscape and portrait modes,
	added $TP_OPTS, made defaults neater.
261290 2.6.1 Stripped out the last remnants of APT and Xerox printers
131290 2.6 Added 2-on-1 and 4-on-1 modes
151190 2.5.1 Fixed minor bug with comment immediately after function name.
	added variable old_state to lang_c.c.
310790 2.5 Tested diffs, fixed minor bug with fontsize of + in added blank
	lines, released.  Next step version 3....
300790 2.4.3 Removed -i (standard input) option.  stdin doesn't work!
260790 2.4.2 Split print.list.c into main.c input.c output.c,
	tidied up printing lines for postscript.
	Line and brace depth numbers in smaller font.
	Blank lines have no line or brace depth numbers.
	Landscape working.  -m, -p and -g working.
	Added plain text "language".
180790 2.4.1 Fixed up postscript headers and footers properly.
170790 2.4 Added -P x|p option for postscript printers.  Very little
	tested, but it works.
110790 2.3 Added -S option, suppressed function index if no functions,
	suppressed file index if only one file.
100790 2.2.5a Ported to DECstations, without aptmac.h or lezzlog.c
	Fixed uninitialised pointer bug in index.c
	Changed opr to lpr and changed escape strings
	via #ifdef APT...
140390 2.2.5 changed coding standards - { put on same line
	as while, if, etc. to reduce number of lines.
280290 2.2.4 static char_usage retval in printnextline()
	was set to INPUT_END at beginning of second
	pass (value inherited from first pass).  This
	had the effect that if deleted lines were
	printed before source then the INPUT_END was
	taken to be the true retval and only the
	deleted lines were printed.  So a line
	initialising retval at beginning of second
	pass was added.
270290 2.2.3 a few pascal bugs in lang_pascal.c fixed after
	trying it out on a decent pascal program
	for the first time.  Also no_of_functions
	in index.c initialised explicitly.
130290 2.2.2 init_diffs() was called too early in getnextchar,
	and getnextline() was getting confused right
	at the end of a file about which file the
	diffs were for.  So init_diffs call was
	moved to getnextline().
060290 2.2.1 Newpage was treated like newline - so line
	were wrong.  This showed up with -O and -P
	options in files with newpage characters.
	Fixed by not treating newpage like newline
	in getnextline().
240190 2.2 goes through lint (more or less), index functions
	expected short, got long as param - potential bug.
230190 2.1 with -P option (multiple files diffs) released.
	bug with param ending ...[]; fixed.
	function names in headers starting too early
	fixed.
220190 2.0 with -O option (single file differences) released
261089 First public version released!
