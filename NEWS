Reverse history of Trueprint:

Version 5.2:
	As of this release I'm going to include the contributors name
	in every change description.  Sorry I didn't do that for version
	5.1.
	+ Added NEC SuperScript 870 printer details (Craig Pinfold).
	+ Added A4 settings for HP Laserjet 4 Si MX (Ian Brown).
	+ Use configure to find the proper install tool (George Lindholm).
	+ Use mandir and man1dir vars in Makefile properly (Michael Somos).
	+ Added missing colon to printers file (Michael Somos).
	+ Handle unknown language with a message instead of a core dump
	(Craig Pinfold).
	+ Added -R to specify postscript level (Ian Brown).
	+ Initialize use_environment in main() (Ian Brown and others).
	+ Added <stdlib.h> to lang_java.c to get abort() (Ian Brown).
	+ C++ comments are now recognized in C code.  OK, this isn't ANSI
	but GCC is a better standard than ANSI any day... :-)  This solves
	a problem reported by Bruce Tenison.
	+ Changes made to support compiling for Microsoft Windows
	platforms are added (Ian Brown).
	+ Option -u added: --u will suppress even minimal headers, footers
	and left margin line (suggested by... )
	+ When using the perl5 "use subs" pragma, trueprint incorrectly
	identifies "s" as a subroutine.  This is fixed in lang_perl.c with
	a fix submitted by Jim Eshleman.
	+ Added printer HP Laserjet 8100N (Kris Berbeeck).
	+ Added printer CalComp (sorry, I lost the name of the contributor -
	send me a mail and I'll add it in the next release)
	+ Added support for language pike (see pike.idonex.se) (Martin Bahr).
	+ Rewritten man page (see author in the man page itself).

Version 5.1:
	Many thanks to everybody who gave me feedback and reported
	problems in version 5.0!  I've found the best advantage of
	making Trueprint a GNU program is the users!  The changes
	in 5.1 are all relatively minor - there are no major rewrites.
	+ make check now uses gmtime instead of localtime, so you
	don't need to live in Boston to have the tests succeed.
	+ make check now ignores any DEFAULT_OPTS that might be set
	in trueprint.h.
	+ If the output is sent to a postscript file then it is
	no longer created with the execute bits set.
	+ In version 5.0 the documentation stated that the default
	behaviour was to NOT have page breaks after functions; however
	the code disagreed with the documentation.  The code has been
	changed to fit.  If you want to change this back, set
	DEFAULT_OPTS in trueprint.h to "--page-break-after-function"
	+ .pm is now recognized as a suffix for a perl file.
	+ Minor tweaks were made to the Makefile to make it easier
	to generate a RPM package.
	+ Postscript comments generated correctly with page information.
	+ With no line numbers or braces depth, a thin line is still
	printed on the lhs of each page.
	+ In headers, footers and other strings, %c and %C can be used
	to get the modification time of the file in short or long format.
	+ When using stdin, the "filename" in headers and footers appears
	as "-" instead of "stdin" as it did in earlier versions.
	+ -r/--redirect-output sends output to .ps file named after 1st arg
	+ -L/--minimum-line-length sets the minimum line length for
	lines produced using intelligent line wrap.
	+ A dummy gettext() is now included in case gettext() doesn't exist
	on the system.
	+ The standard GNU files getopt.c, getopt1.c and getopt.h are included
	in case the system doesn't have getopt_long.
	+ A bug in shell language handling which caused a coredump is fixed.
	+ Perl should print POD documentation as comments.
	+ I had many people suggest that the printers file should
	move; I'm not moving it yet though.  My plan is to change
	the format of the printers file to include (among other things)
	options to be used for each queue, the possibility of multiple
	virtual printers for one queue, passing options through to
	lp or lpr (so you can e.g. select paper from different trays),
	and (most important) a version id so that all future versions
	of trueprint will be able to read older printer files.  When
	I make this change I'll move the printers file so that older
	versions of trueprint will still be able to find a printers
	file they understand in /etc.
	+ Various other minor changes were also made.
Version 5.0: Trueprint GNU
	Changed code to adhere to GNU coding standards.
	Added long options.  Short options that used to start
	with '+' now start with '--', e.g. +I is now --I.
	Default is "off" for page breaks after function calls.
	Added texinfo documentation.
020299 4.1.2 Fixed waiting for child pid so lpr message appears
	before trueprint returns.
	Fixed bad interaction between turning off linewrap and
	turning off linecount.
	Fixed get_function_name() so it can be called many times
	for the same page (by removing static qualifier to
	current_function).
	Included changes from James Card: added .H & .C as valid C++.
	Fixed tab expansion (tab character was included in output).
072298 4.1.1 Added C++ & Verilog support and updated the man page.
	Fixed crash when $USER not set. Map lf/cr (MS-DOS line end) to
	cr, and cr/ff to ff.  Added -J for holepunch gap at top of
	page. Improved message for an unknown option.  Empty
	input -> no print job.  Added file COPYING, which contains
	the GPL.

        makefile

260790 2.4.2 Split print.list.c into main.c input.c output.c,
	tidied up printing lines for postscript.
	Line and brace depth numbers in smaller font.
	Blank lines have no line or brace depth numbers.

	Fixed uninitialised pointer bug in index.c
	Changed opr to lpr and changed escape strings
	via #ifdef APT...
140390 2.2.5 changed coding standards - { put on same line
	as while, if, etc. to reduce number of lines.
280290 2.2.4 static char_usage retval in printnextline()
	was set to INPUT_END at beginning of second
	pass (value inherited from first pass).  This
	had the effect that if deleted lines were
	printed before source then the INPUT_END was
	taken to be the true retval and only the
	deleted lines were printed.  So a line
	initialising retval at beginning of second
	pass was added.
270290 2.2.3 a few pascal bugs in lang_pascal.c fixed after
	trying it out on a decent pascal program
	for the first time.  Also no_of_functions
	in index.c initialised explicitly.
130290 2.2.2 init_diffs() was called too early in getnextchar,
	and getnextline() was getting confused right
	at the end of a file about which file the
	diffs were for.  So init_diffs call was
	moved to getnextline().
060290 2.2.1 Newpage was treated like newline - so line
	were wrong.  This showed up with -O and -P
	options in files with newpage characters.
	Fixed by not treating newpage like newline
	in getnextline().
240190 2.2 goes through lint (more or less), index functions
	expected short, got long as param - potential bug.
230190 2.1 with -P option (multiple files diffs) released.
	bug with param ending ...[]; fixed.
	function names in headers starting too early
	fixed.
220190 2.0 with -O option (single file differences) released
261089 First public version released!
