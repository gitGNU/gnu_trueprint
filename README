To install trueprint:
---------------------
1) Unpack trueprint.uu using uudecode, gunzip, tar.

2) Run the configure script.  This will create a Makefile and a config.h.
   The configure script has been generated using GNU autoconf - use
   `configure --help' for a list of options that you can specify.
   The most relevant option is `configure --prefix=PREFIX' - by
   default trueprint will be installed under /usr/local; you can
   change this by setting the installation prefix with the `--prefix'
   option.  However if you want to install trueprint under /usr/local
   you should be able to just run `configure'.


   `configure' will use your PATH to find `diff'.
   If you don't have a `diff' in your path then the diff
   features of trueprint will not be built.  If
   `configure' can't find a `diff' then you should modify your
   PATH and re-run `configure' - the diff features are very powerful
   and are used very often.

3) If your print command needs special options to get it to print
   postscript files then add them to the definition of PRINT_CMD
   in `config.h'.


4) If you get cover sheets by default on your printouts and you don't
   want them on trueprint output (because trueprint generates its
   own cover sheet) then add the appropriate option to the definition
   of PRINT_CMD in `config.h'.  Alternatively if you want to suppress
   the trueprint-generated cover sheet then you should add "-C"
   to the definition of DEFAULT_OPTS in trueprint.h.  If you do this
   then you can still print with the trueprint-generated cover sheet
   by specifying `+C' on the command line.


5) Edit the `printers' file.  It currently contains a list of printer
   types that may or may not include your printer types, and a list
   of specific printers that almost certainly will not include your
   local printers.  You should leave the `type' lines and delete
   the `printer' lines, though you can use them as examples when
   adding your own printers.  If you need to add a new type, you can
   use the postscript file 'testprint' to find what the entry for a 
   specific printer type should look like - simply print it and it
   will print the four numbers needed in the printers file.  If the
   printout looks the same as the contents of the file then your printer
   is not a postscript printer and will not work with trueprint, or
   you need to use a different command to print the file - in this
   case make sure that the PRINT_CMD in config.h is set to a command
   that can print out postscript files properly.

   THE PRINTERS FILE HAS A DIFFERENT FORMAT INTRODUCED IN VERSION
   4.0.  If you are upgrading to 4.0 or later from 3.6.5 or earlier
   then you will need to rewrite the printers file.

   If you have a printer type that is not listed in the printers
   file distributed with the source then mail me the details at
   enhance-trueprint@gnu.org.  I'm always interested in adding new printer
   types.

6) make trueprint

7) make check

   This does not test:

   - getting the time or environment variables (except for TP_OPTS,
     TP_PRINT_CMD, or TP_DIFF_CMD) from the OS;
   - printing multiple copies, and printing to different destinations;
   - reading the printers file.
   - using string parameters with spaces in them (due to a restriction in
     shell).

   Some of the tests may fail.  If they do then look at the appropriate
   .dif file in tests, e.g. tests/test10.dif.  Some failures may not
   be significant enough or may not really be failures.  However if any
   of the tests do fail then please let me know at bug-trueprint@gnu.org,
   whether or not you are able to resolve the problem yourself.

8) make install

   This will install all files that are needed to run trueprint into
   their appropriate directories.  You probably want to be root when
   you run this.

   In older versions of trueprint you had to manually install the printers
   file and you needed to ensure that the code defined the correct pathname.
   In version 4.1 and later the printers file is installed by the makefile.

Once you've built the tool you'll have a man page which describes
the features, and you can get a list of all valid options by
using the -H option to trueprint.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you have problems installing then check the definitions in `Makefile'
and `config.h'.  Bear in mind that these are generated files and if you
re-run `configure' then they'll be overwritten by new versions.

If you've installed trueprint and you try printing but no printout appears
then check the value of PRINT_CMD in `config.h'.  You should also check
that you have the environment variable $PRINTER set to the name of the
printer you want to use, or that you pass the correct value to the -P
or -d flag.

If printout does appear but it is all very strange-looking text then
your printer is almost certainly printing the postscript input as
plain text.  Make sure that your printer is a postscript printer and
that the print command defined as PRINT_CMD in `config.h' will accept
postscript.  You can use the postscript file `testprint' to try it out.

If all else fails then send me mail with as much information as you
can, including copies of Makefile and config.h, the type of system
you're trying to install on, the version of your C compiler and `make'
tool, and anything else you think might be relevant.  If you're able
to build trueprint but can't execute it then you should also send the
output of `printenv'.

To install trueprint for multiple architectures:
------------------------------------------------
To install trueprint for multiple architectures from one set of source
code, first create a subdirectory for each architecture, then
cd to each directory, run `../configure', and follow the rest of
the instructions above.   To do this you will need a version of
make that understands viewpaths - GNU make will work as will most
modern versions of make.  If you don't have a version of make that
understands viewpaths then you should simply make multiple copies
of the entire source directory, one for each target architecture.


Other notes:
------------
If there are other languages that you would like to have supported
just let me know.  I'm planning to support mib files soon (mib
files document management objects for SNMP systems).

If you find any bugs then mail me.  I need to have enough information
to be able to reproduce the bug, so you should send me the file or
files that you were printing, the exact command line you used, and
your environment (use printenv or env).  You should be using the
latest version of trueprint - if you aren't and I can't reproduce
the bug with the latest version then I'll simply ask you to upgrade.
Otherwise I'll try to fix the bug and I'll send you the fixed version.

If you have any enhancement requests then mail me.  I can't promise
anything but I'll do my best.

Dedication:
-----------
Version 5.0 of GNU Trueprint is dedicated to everybody in the computing
industry who has made their work freely available to the larger
community.  I got where I am only because I can stand on the shoulders
of giants...
